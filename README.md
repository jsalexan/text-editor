  ## Description
  This application is a simple text editor. It's deployed to Heroku, but, as a PWA, it can be installed on your desktop for offline usage. 
  <br>

  For my application, I used the following technologies: Express, NodeJS, Heroku, IndexedDB, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, JSON, and Git.
  <br><br>
  Creating the code was fairly simple, but figuring out how to correctly install and run the application was tricky for me. There were three package-jsons, which led to some confusion for a while. Otherwise, it was a great project to start learning about the inner workings of PWA apps. 
  <br><br>
  I'm not sure I would add anything to this application, as simplicity is its hallmark. But I look forward to using this as a prototype for other PWAs.
